                <div id="accordion">
                  <h3>Day 1</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Direct arrival at the hotel (optional airport transfer). Meet the tour consultant at the hotel / Lodge this evening for pre-climbing briefing. The tour consultant will give you guideline on what to expect from the first day of the trek to the last and final preparations for the tour. If you have any last minute questions it will be the best time to ask for answers and clarifications.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <h3>Day 2</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Once your kit has been loaded, you will be driven to the Marangu Park gate where formalities are completed with the help of our experienced Shah Tours staff. From Chanya Lodge the drive takes around 1 hour drive and it takes you to a 1000 metres altitude: the gate is at 1860 metres. Expect the gate formalities to take an hour: however if you are lucky it may be less. Trying to identify birds, flowers and trees may help pass the time. Additionally, make sure you have enough drinking water for the day and a packed lunch.When you meet your guides and porters, try to remember their names and faces. They are about to become very important people in your life for the following days and by the end of the week you may think of them as supermen. Unless it has or is raining and the path is wet and slippery, this walk may seem disarmingly simple; nevertheless, maintain a slow, steady pace anyway, to help your body to acclimatize. If you need to leave the trail for any reason, be sure that somebody knows you have done so. If walking in a group, you may stop together for lunch at a half-way point, or alternatively postpone lunch until you arrive at Mandara Huts.After reaching Manadara Hut if you will be strong enough you will visit Maundi Crater, a 15-30 minute walk from Mandara. This extra effort is rewarded by views of brilliant wild flowers and perhaps superb scenery of Kibo and Mawenzi (as long as it is not cloudy). A hot Dinner will be served in Mandara’s communal dining area prepared by Shah Tour’s supporting chef and other staff.</p>
                  </div>
                  <h3>Day 3</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>After an early breakfast, you will begin the day's walk by clearing the forest and perhaps seeing spectacular views of Kibo and Mawenzi. The vegetation changes remarkably now, and at your picnic lunch (usually at the halfway point) you may see the four-striped grass mice, which are keen scavengers.If it is a clear,cloudless day, you will be enjoying mountain views on a good footpath for majority of this day's walk. You may arrive at Horombo by early to mid-afternoon. If you and your group have chosen an extra day for acclimatisation, you will spend two nights at Horombo Hut, most probably in the same hut (however please leave your gear stowed tidily just in case). A hot Dinner, similar to Mandara, is served in the communal dining hut.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                <h3>Day 4</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>The first part of the walk is similar to the optional saddle walk although the path bears off at a more north-westerly angle.Approaching the high desert of the saddle region, take note of how the giant groundsel persists wherever there is a watercourse. The path becomes steeper, and the landscape becomes even bleaker, as you approach Kibo Hut.You may reach Kibo Hut by early afternoon for a well-earned rest before the major challenge of the night’s summit attempt. Ensure that you purify or have plenty of drinking water for the nights walk, and pack it so your body warmth reaches the water, otherwise it will freeze.The most common mistake people make at altitude is not drinking enough water! Before you start for the summit make sure there is enough battery and space in your camera and check or replace your head-torch battery. Pack enough snacks and morale boosters to see you through the walking during the night; arrange your warmest clothing ready for action, including gloves, hat and thermals. Then put your head down and sleep for as long as you can. If you cannot sleep then relax and think peaceful thoughts: your body needs to rest before the very strenuous 24 hours ahead.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                    <h3>Day 5</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>You will be woken up around midnight by your guide to climb through the night. This is mainly because you need the time to try to reach the summit and still be able to descend in daylight. To reach your next night’s accommodation via Uhuru, you need not only to gain 2175 metres of vertical height.  Before waking up, slip into as many layers of clothing as you have: you will be cold, perhaps very cold, to start with, but may need to shed layers after you have been climbing for a while. On the other hand, if a high wind gets up, you may become colder than ever, especially your hands, feet and ears.  Eat and drink whatever is possible. Check that you are drinking water and snacks are handy and that the water will not freeze. When your head-torch is switched on, take care not to dazzle others by looking directly at them. If there is moonlight, you may not need the head-torch.  The first half of this ascent is on a steep, winding rocky path. Try and maintain a very slow, steady pace: this may be less tiring than constantly stopping for shorter breaks. Make your stride smaller if need be, and don’t be afraid to hang back if the pace is too quick for you. Many people get into a trance-like rhythm, trudging up rhythmically through the starlight. The halfway point is Hans Meyer Cave (5150 metres) where you may have a slightly longer rest.  After Hans Meyer Cave, the path becomes steeper as it zigzags up towards Gilman’s Point. 
                    </p>
                  </div>
                    <h3>Day 6</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>The descent here reverses the first two days' climb, with a lunch stop at Mandara Huts. At the Kilimanjaro National Park gate, before you depart, there is usually the customary tipping ceremony (if well-earned), and if lucky the supporting team will sing the 'Kilimanjaro Song'.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                    <h3>Day 7</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Check-out. End of our services.
