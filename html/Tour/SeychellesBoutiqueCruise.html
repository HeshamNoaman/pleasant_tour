                <div id="accordion">
                  <h3>Day 1</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Fly into Victoria Seychelles airport and board the luxury Pegasus yacht between 3pm - 4pm. While you get to know your cabin, the luxury restaurant, lounge, bar and mini spa, sip on a welcome cocktail and enjoy the fantastic view as you set sail from Port Victoria.
                    Our first destination is Sainte Anne Island, the largest of Sainte Anne Marine National Park's eight islands. Take a cooling dip off the boat while you take in the tropical views and beautiful beaches. Enjoy your first of many fine dinners on board the yacht - the perfect way to begin your adventure.

                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <h3>Day 2</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Depart Sainte Anne Island for the uninhabited Curieuse Island while enjoying a delicious breakfast spread on deck.
                    The red-coloured soil of Curieuse Island is a stand-out feature of the island, especially in contrast to the green vegetation and blue waters. On arrival in Curieuse, you'll see many different varieties of mangrove and coco de mer palm trees, with stunning granite cliffs. Your walking guide will take you to see the giant tortoises in the Curiese Marine National Park, which are native to this area. You might also spot the unusual black parrot and hump head parrotfish.
                    For history lovers, you might be intrigued to know that in the 1800s, Curieuse was home to a leper colony. Today there is a museum and centre where you can find out more.
                    Spend the rest of the day on a hidden spot on the beach or go for a swim or snorkel. Dine on the beach with a barbecue prepared by your hosts and watch the sun as it goes down in this paradise before anchoring overnight.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <h3>Day 3</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>In the morning, your Pegasus yacht continues on her journey to Cousin Island. Known for its bird sanctuary, you'll be treated to nature at its best, with over 250,000 birds to be seen at this special reserve. Owned and managed by Birds International, they protect the species that are abundant on this 29 hectare island, keeping them safe for future generations. Cousin Island is also home to nesting beaches for turtles, a rare sight for visitors.
                    The tour carries on with a stop at Anse Lazio Island, Praslin, which is recognised for its breath-taking beaches and jungle-covered hillsides. While you're here, take a dive and uncover the island's marine life up close in the azure blue waters. You'll anchor here for the night.

                    </p>
                  </div>
                <h3>Day 4</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Aride Island is the next port of call on your Seychelles tour, allowing you to enjoy an excursion led by one of the island’s rangers. Aride Island is a nature reserve and boasts pristine beaches for miles around, with seabirds such as Audubon's shearwater and the Seychelles warbler, along with numerous other species to be spotted. The endangered Wright's gardenia is also native to this island, with its beautiful, fragrant flowers to be found all over the island. 
                    The trip continues with a lunch and swimming stop at the uninhabited St Pierre Island. Small but perfectly formed, this island is known for its fantastic snorkelling.
                    Once the sun sets, you'll continue gliding through the waves on board Pegasus to Baie St Anne, Praslin, for a Creole themed night.

                    </p>
                  </div>
                    <h3>Day 5</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Wake up at Praslin Baie St Anne and embark on an optional tour to Vallée de Mai. This nature park and UNESCO World Heritage site is made up of palm forests, including endemic coco de mer trees, among other varieties. This ancient forest is the perfect spot to see birds, follow a walking trail, and watch thundering waterfalls.
                    In the afternoon, you'll set sail for the islands of Felicite or Grand Soeur for some more diving and snorkelling.
                    In the evening, Pegasus will carry on her voyage to the unspoilt La Digue Island, where you'll anchor at the sleepy port there. La Digue is a charming island with gorgeous beaches, jungle scenery and walking trails galore. This is just another stop in paradise.
 
                    </p>
                  </div>
                    <h3>Day 6</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Set off for some exploration of La Digue with a half-day optional excursion to the small and verdant Veuve Nature Reserve. Here you’ll have the chance to see some rare birds, such as the Seychelles Black Paradise Flycatcher, exotic flora, turtles and other mammals.
                    A visit to the Union Plantation is fascinating and well worth a look. A colonial era coconut and vanilla plantation, with the colonial-style Old Plantation House, you’ll find out how the locals farmed coconut oil here and perhaps see some tortoises along the way. Once you’ve finished your exploration of the plantation, you can carry on to l'Anse Source d'Argent beach - one of the most spectacular beaches in the Seychelles – which is home to a coral reef, white sand stretches and shallow waters. You’ll also pass by some stunning rock formations and will have the chance to buy some mementoes from the main village, on the west coast of the island, La Passe.
                    Back on board, you'll sail to Moyenne Island, where you’ll spend the evening and anchor overnight, ready for exploring the next morning.

                    </p>
                  </div>
                <h3>Day 7</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>On your last full day, take a guided tour around Moyenne Island and discover a bit of its history. Bought by a newspaper editor in the 1960s, the overgrown island was turned into a nature reserve, with an abundance of flora and wildlife, giant tortoises and sea birds. The small island is surrounded by a protective coral reef and offers fantastic beaches and swimming.
                    After your tour, opt for a refreshing swim before tucking into a tempting barbecue served on the beach once again, before setting sail to Mahé's Victoria port in the afternoon. 
                    Once back on board Pegasus, enjoy a final dinner with live music, as you bid farewell to your Seychelles boat trip.
 
                    </p>
                  </div>
                    <h3>Day 8</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>Say goodbye to the yacht and disembark between 9am - 10am, before flying home.
                    </p>
